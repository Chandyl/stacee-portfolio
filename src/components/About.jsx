              <p>Hi. I'm Stacee, nice to meet you. Please take a look around.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>I've been in the beauty industry as a hair stylist for...well, lets just say several years. After both my kids left home for college, I wanted to go to school to learn more about computers.
              I started out first taking courses for Business Office Support Systems. After mastering MS Office, desktop publishing, touch-typing, records and information management, I took a programming course. It was then I realized my passion for the world of web development and the beauty behind building useful websites.
              I have graduated and Iâ€™m now looking for a administrative assistant position or a junior dev position to finally kick start my career and learn among professionals.
